# Symvl Scripting Language

Wellcome to Symvl, yet another Scripting Language. Symvl is written in C++ using Code:Blocks and GCC. Every Part is handwritten, started from the Lexer, Parser, AST and VM. As you can see the Code will compiled just in Time which means we have pretty good executation Times. The Syntax of Symvl is very similar with Lua but there are some decent Differences. At least if you already know Lua there Symvl will be very familiar to you. I chose Lua's Syntax because its easy to learn while its a dynamicially typed Language, surprise.. surprise Symvl too. Symvl can be easily extended with the builtin API Class, allows to add new Functions. There are several Classes use it already like the IO Library, the Math Library and also the Table Library. This brings many possibilities to Symvl. Symvl does support Conditions such as if, elseif, else , while where we already come to Loops with for, for in pairs and so on. Basic Stuff like global and local Variables, same with functions and also User-defined Objects in form of Tables. You will see the similarities to Lua in later Code Examples. The current supported Datatypes in Symvl are Numbers such as Integer and Float, String, Boolean and User-defined Objects which can contain various Data-Structures.
